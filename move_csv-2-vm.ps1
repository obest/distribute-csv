# I've changed primarily the move VM to CSV to CSV to VM.

# ToDo
# 1 Text Modifications
# 2 Test on Windows Server 2012 R2
# 3 Error Handling
# 4 Change Outputs to eventlog so script can be scheduled
# 5 Handle each CSV and not only the one which have to be moved in the loop to have a more complete output
# 6 Optional: Change loop to get all VMs and handle the repective CSV to have a more complete output
